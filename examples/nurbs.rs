//! Let's create a unit circle, as a unit circle is difficult for non-rational curves (bsplines)
//! but are surprisingly easy to do with NURBS.
//!
//! We use the data from the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline#Example:_a_circle) of NURBS,
//! only the knot vector is scaled such that the domain is from 0.0 to 4.0 insteaf of 0.0 to 2Ï€.
